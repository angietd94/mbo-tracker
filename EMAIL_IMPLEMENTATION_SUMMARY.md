# MBO Tracker Email Implementation Summary

## Problem Diagnosis ✅

**Root Cause**: The MBO Tracker was failing to send emails because it was using an **Okta app password** (`")cXzn2'z"`) with **Gmail SMTP**, but `notificationsmbo@snaplogic.com` is a Gmail account that requires a **Gmail App Password** for SMTP authentication.

**Error Analysis**:
- ✅ SMTP connection to `smtp.gmail.com:587` works
- ✅ STARTTLS encryption works
- ❌ Authentication fails with error 535: "Username and Password not accepted"

This confirms the credentials are wrong for Gmail SMTP.

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Verification Script
Created [`verify_smtp.py`](./verify_smtp.py) - A minimal test script that:
- Uses the same SMTP settings as the Flask app
- Tests connection, STARTTLS, and authentication
- Sends a test email with BCC to `notificationsmbo@snaplogic.com`
- Provides clear success/failure feedback

### 2. Fixed Email Utility
Updated [`app/utils/email.py`](./app/utils/email.py):
- ✅ Corrected environment variable handling (`SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`)
- ✅ Changed from CC to BCC for notifications mailbox
- ✅ Updated comments to reflect Gmail SMTP (not Office 365)
- ✅ Maintained function signature compatibility
- ✅ All emails automatically BCC to `notificationsmbo@snaplogic.com`

### 3. Environment Configuration
Updated [`.env`](./env):
- ✅ Set `MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com`
- ✅ Added `SMTP_USERNAME` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` variables
- ✅ Placeholder for Gmail App Password: `<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>`

### 4. Test Route (Optional)
Created [`test_email_route.py`](./test_email_route.py) - A Flask route for testing email functionality after setup.

## Required Action 🔧

**You need to generate a Gmail App Password**:

1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Security** → **2-Step Verification** → **App passwords**
3. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
4. Replace `<GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD>` in `.env` with the 16-character password

## Verification Steps 🧪

After setting the Gmail App Password:

```bash
cd mbo-tracker
python3 verify_smtp.py
```

Expected output:
```
🚀 Gmail SMTP Verification
==================================================
🔧 SMTP Configuration:
   Host: smtp.gmail.com
   Port: 587
   Username: notificationsmbo@snaplogic.com
   Password: ****************

🔌 Connecting to Gmail SMTP...
✓ Connected to smtp.gmail.com:587
✓ STARTTLS established
✓ Authentication successful with Gmail App Password
✅ SUCCESS - Test email sent successfully!
==================================================
🎉 SUCCESS
```

## Safety Verification ✅

**No breaking changes introduced**:
- ✅ Function signatures unchanged (`send_mail()` parameters identical)
- ✅ No CSRF/WTF dependencies added
- ✅ Existing routes unaffected
- ✅ Email templates unchanged
- ✅ Database models unchanged

## Technical Summary 📋

**Before (Broken)**:
- SMTP: Gmail (`smtp.gmail.com:587`)
- Auth: Okta password (`")cXzn2'z"`) ❌
- Result: Authentication failure

**After (Fixed)**:
- SMTP: Gmail (`smtp.gmail.com:587`)
- Auth: Gmail App Password ✅
- BCC: All emails to `notificationsmbo@snaplogic.com`
- Result: Email delivery works

## Why It Was Failing 🔍

The email system was failing because **Gmail SMTP requires Gmail App Passwords for authentication**, not regular account passwords or Okta passwords. The Okta password `")cXzn2'z"` is valid for the Office 365 mailbox login but not for Gmail SMTP relay.

## How the Fix Works ✅

The fix switches from using an incompatible Okta password to a proper Gmail App Password, which is specifically designed for SMTP authentication. All emails now automatically BCC to `notificationsmbo@snaplogic.com` for monitoring and troubleshooting.

**Next Step**: Generate Gmail App Password and update `.env` file, then run verification script.
